# Installation 

1. Open terminal to the project directory
2. Run the following command -
 > npm run start

3. wait until npm installs all the packages and starts grunt
4. create a new file named "config.php" and copy the config code below into the new created file
```php
<?php
	//Configuration File
	//key=>secret
	$config = array(
		'lti_keys'=>array(
			'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY'=>'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
		),
		'use_db'=>true,
		'db'=>array(
			'driver'=>'mysql',
			'hostname'=>'localhost',
			'username'=>'YOUR_DB_USERNAME',
			'password'=>'YOUR_DB_PASSWORD',
			'dbname'=>'YOUR_DB_NAME',
		)
	);
?>
```

That's it! you're done with the setup :)

# Setup
1. Edit config.php with your respective LTI keys and optional database details
2. Host on a https server (LTI with edX requires HTTPS)
3. Add the respective keys in the edX advanced settings
4. Create a new LTI component and point it to the correct URL

# Usage
1. use test.php with LTI to confirm that everything is connecting
2. on each page, include <?php require_once('inc/header.php'); ?> at the top
3. to ensure valid LTI, make sure to run $lti->requirevalid(); directly after header.php

# Testing
For testing we recommend the LTI 1.1 testbed, available at: http://www.imsglobal.org/developers/LTI/test/v1p1/lms.php
